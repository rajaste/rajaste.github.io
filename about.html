  <h1>My passion</h1>
  <p style="font-size:20px"> My passion for design was ignited through the same everyday
    difficulties people have with suboptimal product design on websites, apps, and the like.
    Understanding what happens behind a misplaced button, a broken element, or ineffective design
    principles made me wonder how these problems could be fixed.<br>
    A lot of user-centered design to me is understanding that the way that a user navigates
    through a product IS the blueprint. Designers must meet the user’s expectations of a product,
    considering what preset ideas we have about using said product.
    For example, we all understand what a magnifying glass icon on top of a webpage means without needing
    the label “search”. Following such breadcrumbs, we can craft an efficient,
    user-friendly product with exquisite design.</p>
